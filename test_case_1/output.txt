Parser

    The parser should:
        Start parsing varDefs upon encountering the first "var".
        Accept varSeq entries following the { varSeq } rule.
        Close varDefs after encountering a non-variable declaration (e.g., begin).
    When it encounters a second "var" keyword, it should throw an error, as the grammar does not permit varDefs to appear more than once.
